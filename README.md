# AWS DynamoDB Task Management

This application is a demonstration of the use of [DynamoDB](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb-internet-scale-data-storage-the-nosql-way.html). It uses a custom ORM called DynamoRecord to access the database.

The app is created using Ruby framework [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/darthdeus/dynamorecord). The layout is done using [Twitter Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) and is backed up by some jQuery for all the AJAXy stuff.

The ORM itself has a decent test coverage using RSpec and excercises basic functionality of DynamoDB. IDs are generated via the [UUIDTools](https://github.com/sporkmonger/uuidtools/tree/) gem. Main idea was to get at least some of the ActiveRecord-ish API to DynamoDB using some basic metaprogramming.

Tasks have two attributes, name, which is strored in a string, and tags, which are split by `,` and stored in an array.

If the application stops responding, refresh the page. There might be an issue with internet connectivity.
